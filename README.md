+
+ZPD-language is a Python-first repository intended for exploring language-related tooling and experiments. This README provides a starting point for getting set up, understanding the layout, and deciding what to build next.
+
+## Quick start
+
+```bash
+python -m venv .venv
+source .venv/bin/activate
+pip install -U pip
+```
+
+## Suggested structure
+
+As the project grows, consider organizing it like this:
+
+```
+ZPD-language/
+├── README.md
+├── src/              # library or application code
+├── tests/            # automated tests
+├── scripts/          # helper scripts and one-off tools
+├── data/             # sample datasets or fixtures
+└── docs/             # longer-form documentation
+```
